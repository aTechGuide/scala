  /**
    TYPE CLASS Template Demo
    - It specifies a set of operations for e.g. `serialise` that can be applied to a given type.

    - All the implementers of a Type class are called type class instances.
      Now even though the type class instances are types themselves such as `PartialUserSerializer`
      They're called instances because it doesn't make sense to instantiate them multiple times.
      That's why we often use Singleton objects for them.

      ŸêExplanation for Type Class Concept

      As a data type a normal class describes a collection of methods and properties that something must have in order to belong to that specific types
      For example if it is of type String then it is known to support `length` operation and the type chequer for the compiler can use this information at compile time to find errors in the source code.
      This is a process called a static type checking

      A type class as opposed to a normal class lifts this same concept to a higher level applying it to types
      So it describes a collection of properties or methods that a type must have in order to belong to that specific type class.

      For example if a type belongs to an `Ordering` Type class, then it is known that instances of that type have the ability to compare values and tell if one is less than another.

    Exercise: Equality Type Class
   */

  // Type Class

    def apply(a: T, b: T): Boolean
  }

  // Type Class Instance 1
  object NameEquality extends Equal[User] {
    override def apply(a: User, b: User): Boolean = a.name == b.name
  }

  // Type Class Instance 2
  object FullEquality extends Equal[User] {
    override def apply(a: User, b: User): Boolean = a.name == b.name && a.email == b.email
  }
